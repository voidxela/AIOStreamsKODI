# AIOStreams Kodi Plugin Documentation

## Overview

**AIOStreams for KODI** is a powerful Kodi video plugin that connects to your self-hosted AIOStreams backend, providing seamless access to streaming content with advanced features like Trakt synchronization, intelligent stream selection, and comprehensive metadata integration.

### What Does AIOStreams for KODI Do?

AIOStreams acts as a frontend client for your [AIOStreams backend](https://github.com/Viren070/aiostreams), bringing powerful streaming aggregation directly into your Kodi media center:

- **🎬 Content Discovery**: Browse catalogs, search movies/TV shows, and discover trending content
- **📺 Trakt Integration**: Full sync with watchlist, collections, watch history, and Next Up
- **🎯 Smart Stream Selection**: Automatic quality filtering, reliability tracking, and preference learning
- **⏭️ Autoplay Next Episode**: Configurable auto-play with background stream pre-loading
- **🎨 Rich Metadata**: TMDb/TVDb integration with posters, fanart, cast information, and ratings
- **🌐 Subtitle Support**: Automatic subtitle scraping via AIOStreams backend
- **🎥 Trailer Playback**: YouTube trailer integration for content preview

### Recent searches and favorites

The home folder exposes separate **Search All**, **Search Movies**, and
**Search Series** entries. Submitted non-empty searches are retained as up to
20 recent query-and-scope pairs. Select a Recent Searches entry to rerun its
original scope, or use its context menu to remove one entry or clear the list.

The plugin's **Favorites** folder is a filtered view of Kodi's native Favorites
store. Use Kodi's standard Add to favorites and Remove from favorites controls;
there is no separate AIOStreams favorites database. Kodi does not notify add-ons
about favorite changes, so an open AIOStreams Favorites folder checks at most
once every ten seconds and refreshes only after Kodi's native list changes.

## Required Configuration

### 1. AIOStreams Backend

You **must** have a running AIOStreams instance configured with:

#### Required Components:
- **Metadata Provider**: Should provide stable IMDb IDs; TMDb IDs are also
  supported when reopening a favorite under a different configuration
  - **Recommended**: [AIOMetadata](https://github.com/cedya77/aiometadata) for stability and reliability
  - AIOMetadata provides rich metadata, catalog support, and IMDB ID integration
  
- **Search Provider**: Configure at least one search provider
  - AIOMetadata (recommended) provides unified search across content types
  
- **Scraper**: At least one torrent indexer or debrid service configured

#### Backend Setup:
1. Deploy AIOStreams (self-hosted or via ElfHosted)
2. Configure AIOMetadata as your metadata provider
3. Set up scrapers (torrent indexers, debrid services)
4. Ensure IMDB tags are enabled in metadata responses

### 2. Plugin Settings

Access settings via: **Add-ons → Video add-ons → AIOStreams → Right-click → Settings**

#### Essential Settings:

**General**
- **AIOStreams Host URL**: Your backend URL (e.g., `https://aiostreams.elfhosted.com`)
- **API Timeout**: How long the add-on waits for a backend response

**Playback**
- **Preferred Quality**: Set your preferred stream quality (4K, 1080p, 720p, etc.)
- **Minimum Quality**: Lowest acceptable quality (filters out lower quality streams)
- **Auto-play**: Enable automatic stream selection based on preferences

**Trakt Integration** (Optional)
- **Enable Trakt**: Authorize your Trakt account for sync features
- **Auto-Sync**: Automatic synchronization of watch history and progress
- **Auto-Sync**: Keeps watch history and progress synchronized in the background

{addon.name::exists["ADDON: {addon.name}"||""]}
{stream.size::>0["SIZE: {stream.size::bytes}"||""]}
{stream.proxied::istrue["PROXIED: YES"||""]}{stream.proxied::isfalse["PROXIED: NO"||""]}
{service.cached::istrue["CACHED: YES"||""]}{service.cached::isfalse["CACHED:NO"||""]}
{stream.library::istrue["IN LIBRARY: YES"||""]}{stream.library::isfalse["IN LIBRARY: NO"||""]}
{stream.duration::>0["DURATION: {stream.duration::time} "||""]}
