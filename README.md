A powerful Kodi addon for streaming content from AIOStreams with comprehensive Trakt integration, intelligent stream selection, and advanced playback features.

---

## Overview

AIOStreams Kodi Addon is a feature-rich video plugin that integrates the [AIOStreams](https://github.com/Viren070/aiostreams) backend with Kodi's media center interface. It provides seamless access to streaming content with advanced features like Trakt synchronization, stream quality filtering, reliability tracking, and TMDBHelper integration for enhanced content discovery.

### What is AIOStreams?

[AIOStreams](https://github.com/Viren070/aiostreams) is a self-hosted streaming aggregator that:
- Scrapes content from multiple sources (torrent indexers, debrid services, etc.)
- Provides unified search across streaming providers
- Offers metadata integration via TMDb/TVDb
- Supports subtitle scraping
- Can be hosted locally or via services like ElfHosted

This Kodi addon acts as a frontend client to your AIOStreams backend, bringing all that functionality into your Kodi media center.

## Key Components

- **🎬 Standalone Plugin**: Use AIOStreams with any Kodi skin.
- **🔎 Recent Searches**: The plugin keeps the 20 most recent query-and-scope pairs. Choose a saved entry to repeat the same All, Movies, or Series search; remove individual entries or clear the list from its context menu.
- **⭐ Kodi Favorites**: The Favorites folder shows AIOStreams movie and series entries from Kodi's native Favorites store. Add or remove these with Kodi's normal Favorites controls; the add-on does not keep a second favorites database.
