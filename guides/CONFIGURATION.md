## Recommended Backend Setup

For the most stable and feature-rich experience, it is highly recommended to follow **Tam-Taro's guide** for setting up both **AIOStreams** and **AIOMetadata**.

- **AIOStreams**: The core backend that aggregates your streams.
- **AIOMetadata**: Provides rich metadata, catalogs, and unified search.

Ensure both are correctly installed and communicating with each other.

## Tam-Taro's SEL Lists

I suggest using **Tam-Taro's SEL (Stream Entry Lists)**. These lists are curated to ensure high-quality stream availability and better organization of content. Integrating these into your backend setup significantly improves the discovery process within Kodi.

## Embedding AIOStreams

To serve metadata and catalogs efficiently, you should **embed the AIOStreams instance into AIOStreams**. This allows the backend to act as its own provider for catalogs, ensuring that the Kodi plugin can access all content directly from your hosted instance without relying on external metadata latency for primary navigation.

## Custom Formatter Configuration

AIOStreams allows for highly detailed stream information display. We recommend using the following template for the **Custom Formatter Name**. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Leave the **Description Template** blank and place all the logic into the **Name Template**.

### Name Template
```text
{stream.resolution::exists["RESOLUTION: {stream.resolution}"||""]}
{service.name::exists["SERVICE: {service.name}"||""]}
{addon.name::exists["ADDON: {addon.name}"||""]}
{stream.size::>0["SIZE: {stream.size::bytes}"||""]}
{stream.proxied::istrue["PROXIED: YES"||""]}{stream.proxied::isfalse["PROXIED: NO"||""]}
{service.cached::istrue["CACHED: YES"||""]}{service.cached::isfalse["CACHED:NO"||""]}
{stream.library::istrue["IN LIBRARY: YES"||""]}{stream.library::isfalse["IN LIBRARY: NO"||""]}
{stream.duration::>0["DURATION: {stream.duration::time} "||""]}
{stream.quality::exists["VIDEO: {stream.quality}"||""]} | {stream.visualTags} | {stream.encode}
{stream.audioTags::exists["AUDIO: {stream.audioTags::join(' | ')} | {stream.audioChannels}"||""]}{stream.languages::exists[" | {stream.languages::join(' / ')}"||""]}
{stream.indexer::exists["INDEXER: {stream.indexer} "||""]}{stream.seeders::exists["| {stream.seeders} Seeders"||""]}{stream.age::exists[" | {stream.age} Old"||""]}
{stream.filename::exists["FILENAME: {stream.filename}"||""]}
```

## Important Credentials

Keep a secure note of your specific AIOStreams instance details to ensure seamless connection from the Kodi plugin.

- **AIOStreams Host**: `[Your Host URL]`
- **UUID**: `[Your Instance UUID]`
- **Password**: `[Your Instance Password]`

## Troubleshooting Manifest Updates

If you make changes to your AIOStreams manifest (e.g., adding or removing lists) and they don't appear in Kodi immediately:

1.  **Refresh Manifest**: Go to **Add-on Settings > Advanced > Maintenance** and select **Refresh Manifest Cache**.
2.  **Restart Kodi**: A full restart will often clear persistent plugin caches.
